  There's a plumber named Bob, and he lives in a shack on top of a hill in a
a town called Goldhoof. One morning he received a call, the kind he receives
nearly every day. A woman's bathwater would only come out cold, truly a 
problem for the ages. Bob sat himself down into his worn out truck with groan 
and prepared himself for a perfectly normal fix for a perfectly normal hot
water boiler.
