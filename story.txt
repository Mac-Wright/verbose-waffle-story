  There's a plumber named Bob, and he lives in a shack on top of a hill in a
a town called Goldhoof. One morning he received a call, the kind he receives
nearly every day. A woman's bathwater would only come out cold, truly a 
problem for the ages. Bob sat himself down into his worn out truck with groan 
and prepared himself for a perfectly normal fix for a perfectly normal hot
water boiler.
	On his way to the woman's house he sees a young boy playing on the
 street just ahead of him. He honks his horn and the child picks up his soccer
 ball and hastily runs onto the sidewalk. "It's Bob the plumber!" the child
exclaims. Bob was a legend around these parts; the children idolised him.
Brimming with the confidence given to him by his young admirer, Bob pulls up
 his truck onto the womans driveway and prepares himself for a good days work.
	Before he even knocked the door, the woman's dog -- Henry --
already started barking. Henry knows Bob very well. Every time Bob came, he
always give Henry a lot of treats. After a few seconds, the door was opened,
and Bob was warmly welcamed by the women. Everything seems normal except
the women's face. Bob wondered: "Why do I feel like something is weird about
her face?" To be polite, Bob did not ask further more.
